# Final_Project_bdlmpt0922
Bootcamp Core Code School AI final Project by Jaime Vaquero

## Overview

The aim of this final project is to employ the abilities and understanding acquired during the Big Data and Machine Learning bootcamp to develop a fully operational system for recognizing facial expressions. This project serves as a culminating experience of the bootcamp, providing me with the opportunity to exhibit my grasp of the different ideas and methods learned throughout the course.

- [X]  Version1_Goal: 
    
Develope an AI that can recognize human facial expressions such as: 

    - Anger
    - Disgust
    - Fear
    - Happy
    - Sad
    - Surprise
    - Neutral

- [ ]  Version2_Goals:
Features:

    - Improve dataset and model in order to get a better prediction
    - Based on the emotion, to pop up a movie, song, book, etc. Recomendation in order to vibe with the mood of the identified.
    - Build a Docker image and upload it to a cloud server such Heroku.
